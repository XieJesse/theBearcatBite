A project that updates a firebase realtime database with information from Binghamton University's dining hall menu. The project uses BeautifulSoup to scrape url data from the website and the Google Cloud Visions API to parse text from an image. The resulting data is then manipulated to be put into an organized realtime database, which can be accessed by going to 127.0.0.1:5000 whenever the flask app is running.
